# archapt
for the people who are too stupid to realize that arch's package manager is pacman, not apt

**DISCLAIMER**: This script just converts APT commands to pacman commands. Don't get it twisted, APT wasn't actually ported to Arch, as cool as that might be.

## SUPPORTED COMMANDS
- `install`
- `remove` or `autoremove` (`autoremove` isn't necessary lol, pacman handles dependencies better)
- `search`
- `upgrade`
- `update`
- `list`
- `info`

maybe don't try to run `apt moo`.

**Flags**

- `--noconfirm`: Skips the script and pacman's confirm prompts.
- `--noupgrade`: Uses `-S` instead of `-Syu`. Can't be used with `--update`.
- `--update`: Uses `-Sy` instead of `-Syu`. Can't be used with `--noupgrade`.
- `--dry-run`: Doesn't *actually* run the pacman command. It's just there for your self-esteem.

## INSTALLATION (AUR)
coming soonâ„¢

## INSTALLATION (manual)
### Package (.pkg.tar.xz)
#### Building from Source
**Dependencies:**
- Arch or any Arch-based Linux distro (duh)
- base-devel (install with sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel)
This doesn't work on WSL, because there's no `systemd`.
  
**Instructions**

Open up the terminal, then clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sparkhere-sys/archapt.git
```
`cd` to the directory with the cloned repo. Run:
```bash
makepkg -si
```
...which automatically builds and installs archapt.

If for whatever reason it doesn't work, move `archapt.sh` from the `script/` directory and put it with the PKGBUILD.

#### Local Package
run:
```bash
sudo pacman -U (replace this with the package path)
```

### Script
just download it and put it wherever you want. run this command:

```bash
chmod +x archapt.sh
```

### Binary
do these commands:

```bash
cd /usr/bin
sudo touch apt
chmod +x apt
```

open `apt` with your chosen text editor

copy the script you downloaded and paste it into the file, then save

from there, you can run any of the supported commands! easy as that.
