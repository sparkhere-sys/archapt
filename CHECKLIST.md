# archapt checklist
things that are done will be ~~crossed out~~ based on the **latest commit** and not the latest release

### bugfixes
- none that i'm aware of. make an issue or DM me (spark_sys) on discord

### QOL improvements
- nothing rn

### additions
- ~~new flag: `--norun`~~

### script changes
- ~~don't use `eval`~~
- ~~better flag handling~~
- think of an alternative to `bash -c`

### maybe?
- rewrite in python (as a separate package, so the bash version is still there)
